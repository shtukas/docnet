Welcome to **DocNet** (Multi-user **Doc**umentation **Net**work).

### General Principles

The purpose of DocNet is to provide an easy to use documentation platform, originally developed to help with documentation consolidation at the Guardian. The target audience in th cohort of software engineers, this is (partially) the reason why it exists as a command line tool. 

In its normal use, it allows its users to browse, search, access and with the right crdentials, edit the collections of records holding useful information. "Record" is a generic term for one or more files, and more generally an heteregenous collections of documents. 

More exactly a record can be a piece of text, a file (for instance a picture, a .pdf, file or an Excel spreadsheet), or a directory. In this latter case, there is absolutely no restriction in the content of the directory. It can contain just one file or a few million in any possible file hierarchy. To maintain compatibility with the original system DotNet was a follow up of (Pascal's own Data Repository), a record can also be a URL. 

The collection of records are actually nodes of a semantic network. The network is the structure that all the records/nodes belong to.
