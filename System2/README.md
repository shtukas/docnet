Welcome to **DocNet** (Multi-user **Doc**umentation **Net**work).

### General Principles

The purpose of DocNet is to provide an easy to use documentation platform, originally developed to help with documentation consolidation at the Guardian. The target audience is the cohort of software engineers, but can be used by anyone (although the terminal interface, the starting interface, might limit adoption to engineers). 

In its normal use, it allows its users to browse, search, access and with the right credentials, edit the collections of records holding useful information. "Record" is a generic term for information, documents, files, file hierarchies or link to documents outside the DocNet data store (for instance, linking to an existing onlin Google document).  

The collection of records are actually nodes of a semantic network. The network is the structure that all the records/nodes belong to.
