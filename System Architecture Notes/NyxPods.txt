NyxPods are named folders that are reference points in the nyx graph. They are data point types (replacing the old unique names and the biggest aion points). The notion of aion point if not going to disappear as it will still be useful for transcient file tree

A NyxPod is any folder that has a name which contains the a string of the form NyxPod-<UUID>, for instance: NyxPod-fcb5541a-6e2e-48dd-9981-2f137fe8490c

Note that unlike what it might have been for unique names, the random fragment of a NyxPod must be a uuid. Ideally they should be generated by catalyst itself.
