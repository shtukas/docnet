NyxFiles are named files that are reference points in the nyx graph. They are data point types (replacing the old unique names).

A NyxFile is any file that has a name which contains the a string of the form NyxFile-<UUID>, for instance: NyxFile-fcb5541a-6e2e-48dd-9981-2f137fe8490c

Note that unlike what it might have been for unique names, the random fragment of a NyxFile must be a uuid. Ideally they should be generated by catalyst itself.
